               <p>(Assignment #2)</p>
               <p>Scrabble Scorer is a program written in JavaScript using Node.js on replit.com.  
               To check the score of a word, the user can choose one of three scoring algorithm options.<p>
               <p>Concepts learned:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>Transforming an object containing an array of values for each key into a more search efficient object 
                  containing one value per key</li>
                  <li>Adding new key/value pairs to an object</li>
                  <li>Assigning methods as properties of an object</li>
                  <li>Accessing properties and methods within an array of objects</li>

               <h2 id="P3">Mars Rover</h2>
               <p>(Assignment #3)</p>
               <p>The Mars Rover program, written in JavaScript using Node.js on replit.com, 
               is a simulation for issuing commands to a Mars rover from mission control.  
               Each list of commands is converted into a message and sent to the rover.  
               Upon receiving the message, the rover carries out the commands and creates a response with a completion status for each command.  
               This project was creating using the Test Driven Development software development process whereby each unit test is written (and run) 
               before the corresponding code for each discrete feature is written.  
               The code can be refactored (also done in a TDD process) and the same tests can be used for regression testing.</p>
               <p>Concepts learned:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>Unit Testing using Jasmine, a popular behavior-driven development framework for testing JavaScript code</li>  
                  <ul>
                     <li>Using the describe() function for a suite of tests</li>
                     <li>Using the it() function for individual test specifications</li>
                     <li>Expectations with the expect() function, which takes a value, called the actual, 
                     for comparison to the expected value</li>
                     <li>The expectation function is chained with a built-in Matcher function, 
                     which compares the expected value to the actual value</li>
                  </ul>
                  <li>Test Driven Development - a software development process where each unit test is written first 
                  before writing the corresponding code</li>
                  <li>Exporting functions from modules</li>
                  <li>Classes as templates for creating objects - with class constructors and methods</li>
                  <li>Creating and using instances of objects from classes</li>
               </ul>

               <h2 id="P4">HTML Me Something</h2>
               <p>(Assignment # 4)</p>
               <p>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were used to build a web page. 
               This assignment involved local development with Visual Studio Code and Git, with changes pushed to a GitHub repository.  
               GitHub Pages, a static site hosting service, was used to pull the HTML and CSS files straight from the project 
               repository on GitHub and publish to a GitHub Pages project site.</p>
               <p>Concepts learned:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>HTML for building a web page from scratch</li>
                  <li>CSS to separate content from design and layout</li>
                  <li>JavaScript with an event listener to handle the navigation menu</li>
                  <li>Remote repositories with GitHub</li>
                  <li>Local development with VS Code and Git</li>
                  <li>Git commands learned included:</li>
                  <ul>
                     <li>Getting and Creating Projects – init, clone</li>
                     <li>Basic snapshotting – add, status, commit, diff, reset, rm</li>
                     <li>Branching and merging – branch, checkout, merge, stash</li>
                     <li>Sharing and updating projects – fetch, pull, push, remote</li>
                     <li>Inspection and Comparison – diff, log, show</li>
                  </ul>
               </ul>
